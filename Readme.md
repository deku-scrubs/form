[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

Simple deku form component.  It has no state of its own, and just eliminates a bit of the boilerplate of writing form components.  It is promise-aware, and will translate a promise-returning submit function into `onSuccess` and `onFailure` events.

## Props

  * `onSubmit` called when the form is submitted (unless the form is loading).  May return a promise, which will be used to generate `onSuccess` and `onFailure` events.
  * `onSuccess` if `onSubmit` returns a promise, this is called in the success case.
  * `onFailure` if `onSubmit` returns a promise, this is called in the failure case.
  * `loading` whether or not the form is currently processing a submission - loading state blocks submissions

## Example

```javascript
function render ({props, state}, setState) {
  return (
    <Form onSubmit={submit} onSuccess={success} onFailure={failure} loading={state.loading}>
      <input type='text' name='username'>
      {state.message}
    </Form>
  )

  function submit () {
    setState({loading: true})
    return createUser(state.user)
  }

  function success () {
    setState({
      loading: false,
      message: 'user created!'
    })
  }

  function failure (reason) {
    setState({
      valid: false,
      loading: false,
      message: 'user creation failed (' + reason + ')')
    })
  }
}
```
